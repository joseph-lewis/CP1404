# The smallest number I saw was 5 and biggest number was 20.
# Was always a random number between those numbers
#
# I only saw a variance of 4 numbers (3, 5, 7, 9). It could not have
# produced a 4 as it only appears to increment in 2.
#
# I saw numbers between 2.5 and 5.5 with a lot of decimals after it.
# It never reached it but the smallest number would probably be 2.5 and biggest is 5.5
